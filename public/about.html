    <p>Tejas is a curious and versatile learner with a strong interest in both academics and personal growth. He asks deep and practical questions — whether it’s about technology (like VS Code, programming, or smartphones), daily routines (like skincare or healthy habits), or communication and personality development (such as spoken English and confidence for events like Freshers).
He’s creative and expressive — often exploring ideas like magic tricks, performances, and design. His curiosity extends to understanding real-world systems such as the NCC, Indian Armed Forces, and competitive exams — showing discipline and ambition.
Tejas also values clarity and correctness: he likes to understand how things work rather than just memorizing facts. His questions often build step by step, showing logical thinking and a genuine desire to learn.
In short, Tejas is an observant, tech-savvy, and thoughtful individual who enjoys learning new skills, exploring creative outlets, and improving himself every day.</p>
